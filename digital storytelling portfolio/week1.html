This week we were set with the assignments for our Digital Marketing module. The first assignment is to produce an individual digital marketing campaign for an existing product or service. I&#39;ve started to consider products that I feel would benefit from more exposure, whether it be by appealing to a new audience, or reigniting a spark with the current audience in order to boost sales or awareness. I also want to pick a product that I know quite well, as I will already have some knowledge on the brand, such as their audience and current marketing strategy. 
        <br>
        <br>
For that reason I have decided to produce a digital marketing campaign for the brand Sambazon Acai. This brand sells acai berry products, such as frozen acai, acai powders and supplements and beverages. Acai is a food that is not overly popular here in the UK, however it is something that I am seeing more of in big cities such as London. With increasing trends of veganism, raw foods and healthy eating, I felt this would be a good product to market towards a UK demographic. 
<br>
       <br>
I have started to conduct a situation analysis (or SWOT analysis) on the brand and their current marketing strategy in order to determine where they are successful and where there is opportunity for growth, which you can see below.
