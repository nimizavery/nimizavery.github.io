    <h2>SMART OBJECTIVES</h2>
    <h3>6th April 2020</h3>
    <div class="center"><p><img src="stuart-frisby-B8vwUO2NM9Y-unsplash.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>As with the individual project, for the group marketing campaign it is essential to consider what our SMART goals are. The goal is to encourage our audience to interact with the driverless cars on the Coventry University open day, and at The City of Culture. We are aiming to raise awareness within the 18-29 year old age group by 40% within four months of the open day. The open days and City of Culture are great opportunities to target this audience, as they are likely to be young adults who are starting to look at universities. The goal we have set is attainable because we have the needed tools to create the game, the app and the supporting social media materials.
<br><br>
All group members have also created some user personas to demonstrate what a potential user of the driverless cars would look like.
