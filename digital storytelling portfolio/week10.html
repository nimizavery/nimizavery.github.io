     <h1>RDM Driverless Cars Experience</h1>
    <h2>MARKETING MATERIALS</h2>
    <h3>4th May 2020</h3>
    <div class="center"><p>Following the call from last week, I have began to create a poster and logo for marketing materials that would be seen at the driverless car area on the open day. I am creating these on Adobe Photoshop, and it is important that the poster shows the branding for RDM Group and Coventry University, as well as being something that is visually intriguing in order to draw visitors to the pods. I wanted the poster to give clues to the narrative of the experience, and so I created a gargoyle shaped mask, with Coventry cathedral in the background.
        <br><br><img src="gargoyle%20poster.jpg" width="100%"> <br><br>
I have also synced Adobe XD to my iPad to see exactly how the prototype is working. Other group members have been creating on boarding videos, which will tell the visitors how the experience is going to work, as well as a 2d game that they can play whilst in the pods, social media posts and a Snapchat filter. The benefits of using Snapchat is that it will appeal to a longer audience, as 82% of all Snapchat users are 34 years and younger. The Snapchat filter will also encourage users to connect and interact with the brand, without being required to follow them. The advantage of a filter is that everyone on this platform can access it, which is a good way of gaining a wider reach. <br><br>

The final step of this project is to get it uploaded on to our group website, where we will show all the content for our digital marketing campaign.
